# CSCA48: Introduction to Computer Science II

Will be updated as the semester progresses.

Tutorials begin the second week of classes. 

### Useful external resources:

Resources I personally recommend. These won't be covered in the course.

*   [Codingbat.com - General practice coding in Python and Java](https://codingbat.com/python)
*   [Learn-C.org - A quick crash course on C](https://www.learn-c.org/)
