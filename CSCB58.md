## Frequent Problems
--------------------

### Fails to Compile
--------------------

* Close all programmer windows (keep the main window open)

* On the top menu bar open Tools -> JTAG Chain Debugger

* Click "Test"

* Wait 5 seconds

* Click "Test" again (hopefully it doesn't respond)

* Either:

... Click "Wait" when Quartus crashes

... Wait until 2 error messages appear on the bottom console of the JTAG Chain Debugger window

* Restart Quartus and repoen your porject

Will be updated as the semester progresses...
